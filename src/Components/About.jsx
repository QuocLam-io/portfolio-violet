          Hi Everyone,
          <br /> 
          <br /> 
          &emsp;I'm a software engineer with a background in fullstack development with a particular fondness for frontend. I take on coding challenges with the same enthusiasm of tackling a good puzzle. I enjoying building my stack by teaching myself new technologies (Redux, Typescript, etc.), as well as learning from others.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
        <br />
          Outside of coding, I spend my time trying to eat as many dumplings as I can. Lately I've been reading more books, practicing my moonwalk, and taking care of my cat/master. </p>
        <div
        className="profile-pic-2"
        ></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
